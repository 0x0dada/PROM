# Roland plotter ROMs

These are possibly from a Roland DXY-1300. Got from the [Chiplotle](http://sites.music.columbia.edu/cmc/chiplotle/) mailing list mid-2016. Z80 assembly language. ASM files auto-generated by the poster.

The file `RolandDG_R15209223` looks like it starts with code, and possibly should be at 0000h. I can't ascertain the correct location that the other file (`RolandDG_R15179881`) maps to, but it might actually start with the font table. See how there are 00h bytes followed by bytes with the high bit set? The zeroes could be "end of char" markers.
